# Strategy 201: Stock Index Portfolio

    Performance: annual: 32.81%, ttm: 6.53%, ytd: 23.12%

  
A stock strategy that dynamically and periodically  picks the most outperforming  one from 3 indices. A strategy that smooths the drawdown in the bear markets but rides the bulls. The alternation makes the strategy superb to any individual index in the market and an alternative to buy&hold strategy
