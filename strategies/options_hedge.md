# TBC offers the best hedge instrument for the upcoming China's  first stock index options

On March, 2019, the China Financial Futures Exchange, aka CFFEX, announced the plan to list the very first stock index options, i.e., CSI300 stock index options. The announcement was, however, to some extent, a little surprise that it was not the futures options given that the CSI300 futures IF have been the most successful list by  the exchange, therefore giving rise to an a little bit awkward question: how to hedge the options positions eligibly and effectively?

Stock index futures that are born with backwardation / contango are not ideal instruments to beta hedge the stock index options and stock index ETFs are far from being easy to short and bear discrepancies with the index. Therefore, the absence of an eligible instrument in the original market puts the options market makers , volatility risk premium seekers and arbitrageurs in a vulnerable situation. Fortunately, TBC offers an excellent instrument to save the trouble.

The stock index itself is the best instrument to hedge against its options, as long as it can be traded, which is exactly what the TBC offers. TBC offers a tradable CSI300 under the ticker symbol 000300.SS with a reasonably narrow bid/ask spread and NO commissions. The even more interesting parts are that 1) the customizable leverage saves the capital thus elevating the rate of return and 2) the tiny trading unit, which is far less than a penny, makes the instrument a fine-tuned arsenal for the options beta hedge in a high frequency and  in an atom level.

TBC users are well-positioned to  peek into and grab the risk free arbitrage opportunities in the option chains, which are typically present without efficient hedging tools. For example, the classic put-call parity demands perfect hedging, otherwise the inevitable presence of risk-free arbitrage.

So, get dressed for the banquet by joining TBC !
